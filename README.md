# AI-Exam-API

## Overview
**AI-Exam-API** is an AI Agent API in a comprehensive end-to-end AI solution designed to streamline and enhance organizational training programs. This intelligent ecosystem consists of three specialized agents working in harmony:

1. **Roadmap Agent**: Creates customized learning paths and training roadmaps based on organizational needs and individual skill gaps.

2. **Exam Agent**: Generates tailored assessments, quizzes, and exams that align perfectly with the established roadmaps to evaluate knowledge acquisition.

3. **Document Agent**: Manages, organizes, summaries and retrieves training materials, creating a centralized knowledge repository that supports the entire learning journey.

Together, these interconnected agents form a powerful, cohesive system that guides your team members from initial skill assessment through structured learning paths to final knowledge validationâ€”all powered by advanced AI technology.

The AI-Exam-API is designed for seamless integration with existing learning management systems, providing organizations with intelligent automation tools to make training more effective, personalized, and measurable.
